The Mobile app is created similar to reddit website where users can use the app to see posts on forum and lastest news on Covid-19, they can also do quiz to earns points which can be use to claim rewards like hand sanitizers and face mask. they can also see the live data of the global number of cases and users can also search for a specific country to see their total number of cases as well.
 
## Design Process
 
The Design process behind this is for users to use them as a efficient app to check up on news and updates about Covid-19. this app is more focus for people that wants to know more about Covid-19 or people that wants to keep up with the changes of Covid-19.

As a new user, i wish to know what the number of cases there are in the world, i can just open the app and go over to the live data which will show the live data of the number of cases, deaths and recoveries.

This is our WireFrame that we used when creating the app
